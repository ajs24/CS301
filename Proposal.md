## Project : Character Recognition

This project aims to distinguish the image of the characters from a number plate . We will be using computer vision fundamentals and classification methods to create a program that identifies each character. The data set we will be using is from https://www.kaggle.com/kdnishanth/characterrecognitionfromnumberplate . This data set includes letter from the English alphabet and numbers 0-9. Additionally, there is multiple variations for each character and we will be using Colab to develop our project.  

We can apply machine learning algorithms using the data obtained to analyze each image using image processing techniques. The classification stage will be making that decision and will determine the accuracy for identifying each character. This stage will be in charge of accepting or rejecting the data.
